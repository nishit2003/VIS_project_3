1,2,On Leather Wings,None,Batman,Only one way to find out.
1,2,On Leather Wings,None,Batman,"Yes, Alfred. Do that."

1,2,On Leather Wings,THE TELEPHONE RINGS AND ALFRED ANSWERS,Batman,Appreciate the help doc. I'll return the favor next time you're raising funds. Bye-bye (hangs the call and return to the Batman voice) This computer checked that fiber against every animals species known to man. I went to them because I tought they might know something we didn't. That hair wasn't a brown bats'.
1,2,On Leather Wings,THE TELEPHONE RINGS AND ALFRED ANSWERS,Batman,Computer; check against combined sounds; starlings and brown bats.
1,2,On Leather Wings,THE TELEPHONE RINGS AND ALFRED ANSWERS,Batman,"Incongruity, Alfred? He's lying, and I'm going to find out why."
1,2,On Leather Wings,BATMAN APPEARS IN THE LAB AND ENTERS TO INVESTIGATE,Batman,I'm looking for Doctor March.
1,2,On Leather Wings,BATMAN APPEARS IN THE LAB AND ENTERS TO INVESTIGATE,Batman,Where is he?
1,2,On Leather Wings,BATMAN APPEARS IN THE LAB AND ENTERS TO INVESTIGATE,Batman,He's misguided and a thief.
1,2,On Leather Wings,None,Batman,I got a list of all the items stolen from the chemical labs. Who would've thought they'd be used to create a monster!? -- Maybe I can undo the fate Langstrom has brought upon himself.
1,2,On Leather Wings,None,Batman,I think so.
1,2,On Leather Wings,None,Batman,No. The formula is out of his system. It's over; for now.

1,4,Feat of Clay Part I,BAD NEWS,Batman,(trying to identify Bell) I know my fist has landed on that jaw once before. Bell. Raymond Bell. Of course! Now I remember him. Carries a pocket radio tuned to police band at all times.
1,4,Feat of Clay Part I,BAD NEWS,Batman,Police? What police? What are you talking about?

1,4,Feat of Clay Part I,EXTREME MEASURES PART 2,Batman,Who was Lucius Fox meeting at the tram?
1,4,Feat of Clay Part I,EXTREME MEASURES PART 2,Batman,You lying sleaze! You want to rethink that answer?

1,5,Feat of Clay Part II,PLAN OF ACTION,Batman,Good. Because now I'm sure that that thing I fought at the hospital is Hagen. His condition is apparently the tragic result of an experiment conducted by Roland Daggett. Hagen apparently transforms unconsciously sometimes; like a reflex action.

1,5,Feat of Clay Part II,AFTERMATH,Batman,Look. A piece of clay left behind when they took Hagen's body away. Watch.
1,5,Feat of Clay Part II,AFTERMATH,Batman,"Exactly. (Voiceover) I wouldn't be surprised if the body they took to the morgue was only a shell. Don't forget-- First and foremost, Hagen was an actor. He said it himself, Alfred. He called it a scene. Maybe the greatest scene of his career."

1,16,Eternal Youth,GROVE OF CRIME,Batman,"Poison Ivy. Only you would identify yourself with Demeter, the Greek goddess of plants."
1,16,Eternal Youth,GROVE OF CRIME,Batman,Unusual trees.
1,16,Eternal Youth,GROVE OF CRIME,Batman,This can't be!
1,16,Eternal Youth,GROVE OF CRIME,Batman,(Through gritted teeth) And the convictions of a fanatic!
1,16,Eternal Youth,GROVE OF CRIME,Batman,"You made your secret too accesible, Ivy. I coated my outfit with an herbicidal antidote."
1,16,Eternal Youth,GROVE OF CRIME,Batman,"Justice, yes. But not the vengeance of an eco-terrorist. You're as destructive as those you punish."
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Batman,"(Grabs Harvey's hand) No, Dent! Lets get out of here!"
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Batman,"Look out, Dent!"
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Batman,HARVEY! (Runs towards his fallen friend and looks at the damage) Harvey... No...
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN'S NIGHTMARE,Batman,Harvey!
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN'S NIGHTMARE,Batman,"Harvey, please! Let me help you!"
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN'S NIGHTMARE,Batman,"But I tried, Harvey. I-- (Harvey falls to a certain death) Harvey!"
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,"Just look at the places he's robbed, Alfred. Club 22, Gemini Jewels the Two's Company Cafe."
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,"That won't be a target. Every place Two-Face has robbed is als a front for Rupert Thorne's criminal activities. Unfortunately, he's used up all of Thorne's places."
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,No. I think Two-Face is through humiliating Thorne. Now he wants him out of the way; and I think I know how.
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,I still feel that somewhere inside that monster is my old friend.
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,"You're coming with me, Harvey. I want to help you."
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,"I know that you have friends, Harvey. Friends who love and care about you."
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,What about Grace?
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,"She still loves you, Harvey. She keeps your picture. Every day she waits and prays. She wants you back, Harv."
1,18,Two-Face Part II,BATMAN LOCATES TWO-FACE,Batman,"No, Harvey. Wait!"
1,18,Two-Face Part II,HARVEY CONTACTS GRACE,Batman,Harvey! Where's Harvey?
1,18,Two-Face Part II,HARVEY CONTACTS GRACE,Batman,Yeah. I'm fine.
1,18,Two-Face Part II,RUPERT THORNE VS. TWO-FACE,Batman,Let the law handle it.
1,18,Two-Face Part II,RUPERT THORNE VS. TWO-FACE,Batman,"Where there's love, there's hope, Commissioner. But a little luck wouldn't hurt."
1,18,Two-Face Part II,RUPERT THORNE VS. TWO-FACE,Batman,"For you, Harvey."
1,19,Fear of Victory,PANIC ATTACK,Batman,"He was under a lot of pressure, Robin. You can never tell when... (Batman notices a heist in progress) Oh-oh. Time to punch in!"
1,19,Fear of Victory,PANIC ATTACK,Batman,(notices Robin's panic attack) Robin!
1,19,Fear of Victory,PANIC ATTACK,Batman,Robin... give me a hand!
1,19,Fear of Victory,PANIC ATTACK,Batman,"Alright, Robin. Pull yourself together!"
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE INVESTIGATION,Batman,It's too strange that both you and your roommate would have panic attacks on the same day!
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE INVESTIGATION,Batman,Calm down. We'll get a lead on it! (Batman picks the telegram and notices dust) Did you see this?
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE INVESTIGATION,Batman,Our lead.
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE INVESTIGATION,Batman,"(Batman picks up a lab cat) Take it easy, fella. I suspect the chemical is absorbed through the skin."
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE INVESTIGATION,Batman,"Yet. (Batman takes a mouse to the cat and it is scared) Just as I thought. The fear chemical is activated by adrenaline. So whenever you, or Brian, or any of the other athletes got agitated..."
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE INVESTIGATION,Batman,I'm afraid there's only one person who can answer that
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE ASYLUM,Batman,Has Professor Crane lost his appetite?
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE ASYLUM,Batman,But the Scarecrow is.
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE ASYLUM,Batman,I'd like to make sure of that.
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE ASYLUM,Batman,Then you won't mind if I pay him a visit.
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE ASYLUM,Batman,"Stay with him, Robin."
1,19,Fear of Victory,THE ASYLUM,Batman,(entering Scarecrow's cell) Professor Crane? (Batman learns it's just a dummy)
1,19,Fear of Victory,FIGHTING AGAINST FEAR,Batman,You haven't been watching the sports channel.
1,19,Fear of Victory,FIGHTING AGAINST FEAR,Batman,"Put two and two together, Commissioner. That goon in there works for Leon ""The Bookie"", and word has it he's been taking it on the chin lately."
1,19,Fear of Victory,FIGHTING AGAINST FEAR,Batman,Exactly. A perfect way to scare up some quick cash for his sick schemes.
1,19,Fear of Victory,FIGHTING AGAINST FEAR,Batman,"Easy, Dick. It's bound to wear off. But in the meantime, you've got to fight it! Regain control. Come on."
1,19,Fear of Victory,FIGHTING AGAINST FEAR,Batman,"I thought we'd catch a game tonight. The Gothan Knights are favorite 4 to 1 thanks to their quarterback, Mitch Nole."
1,19,Fear of Victory,FIGHTING AGAINST FEAR,Batman,I'd say it's a good bet.
1,19,Fear of Victory,FIGHTING AGAINST FEAR,Batman,You could be my extra set of eyes. Get in. I'll drive real slow.
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Batman,"Change of luck, Scarecrow?"
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Batman,You're aware that gambling is illegal in Gotham?
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Batman,You have my word Scarecrow. Just don't drop the vial.
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Batman,"Good work, Robin."
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Batman,Looks like you got a handle on your problem.
1,20,I've Got Batman in My Basement,THE HEIST,Batman,And that'll get you five years. With good behavior. (Suddenly Scrap attacks. The thugs escape and Batman finds something) Birdseed?
1,20,I've Got Batman in My Basement,ENTER PENGUIN,Batman,Get out! Now!
1,20,I've Got Batman in My Basement,IN THE BASEMENT,Batman,...c-capsule...
1,20,I've Got Batman in My Basement,IN THE BASEMENT,Batman,...no... visor...
1,20,I've Got Batman in My Basement,BASEMENT BATTLE,Batman,Ma'am.
1,21,Vendetta,INTERROGATING THORNE,Batman,"(Grabbing him) Here's how it works, slimeball. I have questions, and if you have answers, I'll leave you alone."
1,21,Vendetta,INTERROGATING THORNE,Batman,"I was saying, you'd better hope your men are very good shots. It's too hot in here. Let's get some air."
1,21,Vendetta,INTERROGATING THORNE,Batman,Did you order Spider Conway's blow up?
1,21,Vendetta,INTERROGATING THORNE,Batman,Okay. (Leaves Thorne hanging from a ledge)
1,21,Vendetta,BATMAN'S WARNING,Batman,We need to talk. About Bullock. - I think he might have been responsible for the bomb!
1,21,Vendetta,BATMAN'S WARNING,Batman,But you have no proof Conway lied.
1,21,Vendetta,THE CROCODILE'S LAIR,Batman,"Believe it or not, the cellular structure is human, but the texture of it is almost... reptilian."
1,21,Vendetta,THE CROCODILE'S LAIR,Batman,Bullock might not be the primary suspect after all.
1,21,Vendetta,THE CROCODILE'S LAIR,Batman,"""Croc""? Alfred, you're beautiful! (runs off)"
1,21,Vendetta,THE CROCODILE'S LAIR,Batman,You’re no prize yourself.
1,21,Vendetta,THE CROCODILE'S LAIR,Batman,Don't hold your breath.
1,21,Vendetta,KILLER CROC,Batman,"It's taken me that long to search through all this newspapers on micro-fish. Here, from the Miami Times Herald. Four years ago. See. He started out a carnival sideshow attraction, then became a pro-wrestler. Two years later, Croc had moved to Gotham City and turned to crime. He used to be strictly penny-any. Until now, I've never heard of him, but according to this, Bullock busted him based on the testimony of Conway and Joey the Snail."
1,21,Vendetta,KILLER CROC,Batman,And now it's payback time.
1,21,Vendetta,KILLER CROC,Batman,True. But that won't get us Croc. He won't return to his lair now that I know where it is. I'll have to make him come to us.
1,21,Vendetta,SEWER SHOWDOWN,Batman,"Give it up, Croc. I know everything now. You planted that toothpick on the dock, didn't you? And you impersonated Bullock at the jail."
1,21,Vendetta,SEWER SHOWDOWN,Batman,CROC! (The sewers collaps and Batman drags Croc to the surface)
1,21,Vendetta,SEWER SHOWDOWN,Batman,"Because I thought you were guilty too and I was wrong. We may have different ways of enforcing the law, but we both believe in it."
1,22,Prophecy of Doom,BATCAVE AND WAYNE ENTERPRISES,Batman,"(mimicking a prophet) 'Psychic vibrations', Alfred. (Returns to normal voice) Though I bet on a high frequency sonic device. But I have some tricks of my own. I lift Nostromos' fingerprints at the party. There he is. Alias Carl Fowler. Professional actor. Arrested for petty larceny. Hmm... otherwise no criminal record. - That's his partner"
1,22,Prophecy of Doom,BATCAVE AND WAYNE ENTERPRISES,Batman,Still are. I just wish I knew where this act was going.
1,22,Prophecy of Doom,THE GREAT DECEPTION,Batman,"I had to keep up appearances, Alfred. There must be over thre hundred million dollars in that fund."
1,22,Prophecy of Doom,THE GREAT DECEPTION,Batman,For now. But I don't need to be psychic to predict that Ethan Clark is about to undergo a spiritual crisis.
1,22,Prophecy of Doom,THE GREAT FALL... OF NOSTROMOS,Batman,Your turn to see the light!
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Batman,(entering with two knocked out henchmen) Right here.
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Batman,Not exactly.
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Batman,(Grabs Biggis) We've got to get out of here!
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Batman,Stop and we will be! (Puts Biggis on a water canal)
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Batman,"When you taste the prison food, you'll wish I had."
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,WONDERLAND GOTHAM,Batman,I should be so lucky. (Police signal starts flashing) The police emergency band just switched on.
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,WONDERLAND GOTHAM,Batman,"Goodnight, Alfred."
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,WONDERLAND GOTHAM,Batman,Guess I'm elected. (Prepares the Batmobile for ejection) Engage. (After reaching the top of the tower) Lousy night for a swim.
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,WONDERLAND GOTHAM,Batman,Ri-ight. You guys stay calm and--
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,WONDERLAND GOTHAM,Batman,Stop-- NO!
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,WONDERLAND GOTHAM,Batman,"I saw that picture earlier today! In the office of a scientist, who creates circuitry similar to this!"
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,THE MAD HATTER,Batman,What have you done to Marcia Cates and this girl's fiancé?
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,SHOWDOWN IN WONDERLAND,Batman,"They're programmed to attack me, but they won't fight you!"
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,SHOWDOWN IN WONDERLAND,Batman,Then all you've waited for is a puppet... A soulless little doll.
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,INVESTIGATION,Batman,"...to starving refugees in Eastern Europe. Yeah, I know."
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,INVESTIGATION,Batman,"The same someone that lured him into that quicksand trap you mentioned? You know who that sound like, don't you? Wormwood. The Interrogator."
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,INVESTIGATION,Batman,"Maybe. Right now, though, we're not even sure he's in town. But I think I know which one of Wormwood's associates might be able to give me that information."
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,"BATMAN, THE INTERROGATOR",Batman,"I want information from you. By the way, I hope you're not afraid of heights. -- That's all you have on your friend Wormwood?"
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,"BATMAN, THE INTERROGATOR",Batman,"Just one more thing, Baron. I suggest that for your health, you take a vacation. Somewhere far away from Gotham City."
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,FIRST CONTACT,Batman,"(about the Bat-signal) Got a new toy, I see."
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,FIRST CONTACT,Batman,It might get you in trouble with the mayor.

1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,MUSEUM TRAP,Batman,"Those famous figures standing around together? DeLarue's Wax Museum, what else?"
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,MUSEUM TRAP,Batman,All right. All right! Turn off the gas. You win.
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,MUSEUM TRAP,Batman,Satisfied?
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,THE CONSPIRACY,Batman,...to wear them!
1,25,The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy,THE CONSPIRACY,Batman,From the day you first walked in here.

1,26,The Clock King (episode),THE CLOCK KING,Batman,"I want some answers, wise guy. Talk!"
1,26,The Clock King (episode),TIME INVESTIGATION,Batman,"If the creep with the clocks did sabotage the entire traffic system, he had to come here to do it. Wait here."
1,26,The Clock King (episode),TIME INVESTIGATION,Batman,"What kind of saboteur uses a $6,000 Metronex to trigger a time bomb?"
1,26,The Clock King (episode),TIME INVESTIGATION,Batman,"Most jewelry stores register the serial number of the Metronexes they sell. Let's see what the police database turns up. Temple Fugate - 362 Brayfogle Let's go, Alfred."
1,26,The Clock King (episode),TIME INVESTIGATION,Batman,What is is about that particular clock tower? He's got more data on it that anything else in the city.
1,26,The Clock King (episode),TIME INVESTIGATION,Batman,The location of Gotham's neutral main branch.
1,26,The Clock King (episode),TIME INVESTIGATION,Batman,Yes. The time locks. Fugate.
1,26,The Clock King (episode),KILLING TIME,Batman,"I'm here to clean your clock, Fugate."
1,26,The Clock King (episode),KILLING TIME,Batman,"Give it up, Fugate. Hill committed no crime against you."
1,26,The Clock King (episode),KILLING TIME,Batman,"Very clever, but it only takes me a thirtieth of a second... to do this! (Throws a kick at Fugate and the Clock Tower starts to collapse) Fugate! You can't escape!"
1,26,The Clock King (episode),KILLING TIME,Batman,FUGATE!
1,26,The Clock King (episode),KILLING TIME,Batman,"No trace of this ""Clock King"", though."
1,26,The Clock King (episode),KILLING TIME,Batman,"If I could, he could."
1,26,The Clock King (episode),KILLING TIME,Batman,"I wouldn't be surprised, Commissioner. In fact, I'd say it's only a matter of time..."

1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAST,Batman,"Not this time, Dick."
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAST,Batman,I'm fine. C'mon. There's nothing more to do here.
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAST,Batman,He’s not Samurai. He’s a ninja. They're spies and assassins. Their only code is to get the job done. I know him.

1,31,"Tyger, Tyger",THE SEARCH,Batman,My analysis shows that it's similar to the compound that turned you into the Man-Bat.
1,31,"Tyger, Tyger",THE SEARCH,Batman,What is it?

1,32,Dreams in Darkness,PROLOGUE,Batman,Did you contact Commissioner Gordon and Doctor Wu?
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,PROLOGUE,Batman,Haven't you listened to anything I told you?!?
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,PROLOGUE,Batman,BARTHOLOMEW!!! WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME!!!
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,PROLOGUE,Batman,"""There's always time to heal"", the doctor told me, but he was wrong. There was no time left. Not for me, not for him, and not for Gotham City. And as long as I remained trapped in Arkham, there was nothing I could do, except wait for the end and remember the beginning."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,"The word on the street was that something big was going down at the Health Spring Spa. - I guessed a robbery, but that night... I guessed wrong."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,He thought he was going to do something to the Spa's drinking water. I decided to make him think again.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,"He was in no condition to tell me what he was trying to do, or who he was working for. My only clues were the strange device he had welded to the drinking water pipe and one half of a video communication link. As for the gas; I thought it had no effect on me... but I was wrong again."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,(in the Batcave after seeing the Joker and moving to investigate) Wha-- Alfred?
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,No-- I-- must've been staring at the screen too long.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,Someone stole a huga water purification system last month. This device is a miniature test model; which means someone was trying to contaminate the Spa's water.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,The gas residue was completely oxidized. I can't be sure-- yet.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,The man I had captured was still on the hospital. The doctors said he was able to talk...
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,"...but what he had to say didn't make any sense. According to the chart, he was hallucinating wildly due to a massive fear reaction in the amygdala of his brain."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,I need to know what has affected this man.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,Because it may have affected me too.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,But I will begin to hallucinate as well?
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,I couldn't risk being out of action for that long. What had happened at the Spa was only a trial run. Someone was planning to poison Gotham's water supply with the same fear inducing gas. And I knew only one person capable of such a deed.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,uh! Robin!
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,R-Robin... lookout... d-don't do it... it's a trap...
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Batman,Lookout!-- Joker's got a bomb!
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,FEAR,Batman,"I've already told you. When the gas is put into Gotham's water supply, the entire city will be affected. Why won't you believe me?"
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,FEAR,Batman,I didn't come here for help. I came to find the criminal behind all this.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,FEAR,Batman,They're not responsible for this madness. There's only one criminal twisted enough to come up with such a scheme. The Scarecrow.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,DISTURBED,Batman,Who's there? -- Mom? Dad? -- No... stop... No!... Don't go in there! -- NNOOOO! (The hallucination ends)
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,DISTURBED,Batman,"Isn't that why I'm here? Because I'm... ""disturbed""?"
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,DISTURBED,Batman,And he's not there.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,DISTURBED,Batman,No security is absolute. The Scarecrow's already proved that! But I think I know where he is.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,DISTURBED,Batman,Where's Arkham's water supply?

1,37,Moon of the Wolf,POLICE INVESTIGATION,Batman,The victim's name was John Hamner. From his uniform I'd say he works for the zoo. I doubt it's a coincidence.

1,37,Moon of the Wolf,THE TRAP,Batman,"No, Alfred. Just searching for some connection between Hamner, those stolen wolves and that hairy weirdo. The hairs check out as genuine wolf hair.

1,44,Off Balance,SHADOWS,Batman,"Information. On the Society of Shadows. Word is, they've started operating here. Tell me all about them."
1,44,Off Balance,SHADOWS,Batman,It'll have to do. Now talk.
1,44,Off Balance,SHADOWS,Batman,Who runs the show?
1,44,Off Balance,SHADOWS,Batman,You'll pay for that!
1,44,Off Balance,VERTIGO,Batman,"Over here, Jim."
1,44,Off Balance,VERTIGO,Batman,"And when I tried to nail them, they used some sort of gas to erase their own minds."
1,44,Off Balance,VERTIGO,Batman,"But something Twitch said, makes me think they're going after WayneTech's new sonic drill. Tonight, when it comes into Gotham, tell Bullock he should add more guards. Just to be safe."
1,44,Off Balance,VERTIGO,Batman,"And I think you'll do ten to twenty in Stonegate, minimum!"
1,44,Off Balance,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,"Had to be, Alfred. He'd never have been able to escape if she hadn't shown up! But she was the only one that wasn't affected by his weapon."
1,44,Off Balance,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,"That eye-piece of his. I think it gives off some kind of radiation. It must distort visual perception and sense of balance, somehow. Creating the illusion that everything around you is topsy-turvy."
1,44,Off Balance,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,"Not that it matters. Nothing about that can give me a clue about his whereabouts. He mentioned returning to his base ""before the tolling of the hour"". Which suggests a clock tower or church-bell. Then fled west, yet there's no such structure that could conceal a hideout up within fifteen miles to the west."
1,44,Off Balance,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,Alfred! You're brilliant!
1,44,Off Balance,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,"With my head turned around like that, I couldn't tell one direction from the other. They didn't escape to the west, they went east! - There, Alfred! That has to be the place!"
1,44,Off Balance,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,Four against one. Nasty odds!
1,44,Off Balance,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,So I see.
1,44,Off Balance,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,Don't mention it. Just who's side are you on?
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,I've been called worse. What happened to-- My mask! What have you done with it?
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,Then you know-- you know that I'm--
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,Just who are you? What are you doing here?
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,What kind of business?
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,Point taken. It's a simple enough lock. I can get it open with... MY BELT!
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,"I appreciate the sympathy, but what we need right now, is a lock pick!"
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,Sounds like you two have a history.
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,How kind of him. Why should your father even care?
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,Lab? What lab?
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA,Batman,Naturally. But what other choice do we have?
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,"Your little dizzifying trick won't stop us, Vertigo."
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,You okay?
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,"I don't do helpless. Come on, take my hand! I can get us through this!"
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,"I trusted you. Now, it's your turn. - Jump!"
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,Down! - Stop! - Clear.
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,"Simple, I just kept my eyes closed."
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,The only way to neutralize the vertigo effect was to rely on my other senses to see us through.
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,"Up. - Going somewhere, Vertigo?"
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,Nothing is impossible!
1,44,Off Balance,SHOWDOWN,Batman,No!
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA'S BETRAYAL,Batman,"Without Vertigo to lead them, his agents have all fled?"
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA'S BETRAYAL,Batman,Well. I've got to get back this to Gotham City.
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA'S BETRAYAL,Batman,I thought I finally knew which side you were on. I should have known better... Considering that you knew where everything was in the monastery. How could you have unless you were one of them?
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA'S BETRAYAL,Batman,This is not over!
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE FISH,Batman,He's made his move!
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE FISH,Batman,"The dissection tray, please, Alfred."
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE FISH,Batman,"Normal criminals usually have logical motives, but the Joker's insane schemes make sense to him alone."
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Batman,"Well, he's not out to poison people. This diluted toxin only affects fish."
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Batman,"If I got in this easily, so will the Joker."
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Batman,"And in his sick mind, that's the joke, Mr. Francis. -- Feeling alright?"
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Batman,(to Gordon) GET THIS MAN TO A HOSPITAL! NOW!
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Batman,He'll be alright once the anti-venom kicks in.
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Batman,He didn't want us. That gas is part of a binary compound. The Joker exposed Francis to the other part when he threatened him this morning.
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE CAT,Batman,A Joker fish!
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE CAT,Batman,"Even drugged, the cat went straight for his master."
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE CAT,Batman,Commissioner. Have a look at this fish. It's a Japanese Tang. Not native to Gotham's cold waters.
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Batman,Bullock.
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Batman,WAIT! Let him go! I'm the one you're after.
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Batman,(to Bullock) You okay?
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Batman,"There's no place left to go, Joker."
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Batman,"Believe me, Jim, I wish it were true, but deep inside, I doubt it."
1,47,Harley and Ivy,HOT CHASE,Batman,"Next time, clown."
1,47,Harley and Ivy,HUNTING THE LADIES,Batman,"This is one sister-act that's hard to follow, Alfred. The only clue I have is the soil analysis from the tire tracks. Hmm. Contains the same compounds you'd find at a toxic waste dump."
1,47,Harley and Ivy,LOST AND FOUND,Batman,"Evening, ladies. Playtime's over."
1,47,Harley and Ivy,NO MAN,Batman,"Man or woman, a sick mind is capable of anything."
1,47,Harley and Ivy,NO MAN,Batman,"Stop shooting, you lunatic! We're sitting on a powder keg!"
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE SQUID,Batman,Looks like a drug run to me. Someone's flooding the streets with that trash! I want his name.
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE SQUID,Batman,Back off!
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE SQUID,Batman,Stop struggling! Let go!
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Batman,(slams Throne's arm on his desk) That's for pulling a gun. (throws Thorne across the room) And that's for the drugs. (finally punches Thorne out cold) And that one's for any I missed.
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Batman,"I swam away before the gas tank exploded. But I thought, since you believe I was dead, I'd tail you and see who was calling the shots."
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Batman,That's right.
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Batman,You're still an accomplice to Thorne's gang.
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Batman,"I don't know. In the right environment, a man of your dangerous reputation could still get a lot of respect."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),RESCUE,Batman,Thanks.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),RESCUE,Batman,I heard about the mint robbery. I can help prove you didn't do it.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),RESCUE,Batman,If you wanna go it alone.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),RESCUE,Batman,"I'm sure whoever framed you, knew how your trick was done. They may have left a clue at the mint."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Batman,Just relax.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Batman,"Look. This line was recently scraped into the floor. Whatever made it, left shards of glass too."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Batman,Like the one you used to reflect the hologram of the vanished mint.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Batman,"I think the money was stolen before you got here. The thief reflected a hologram of the cash, while you did your trick, then quickly hid the mirror when it was over."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Batman,He didn't. It's sill here.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Batman,Or someone who knows their methods... like Montague Kane.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Batman,"I'll settle with Kane. Meantime, I'd better drop you some place safe."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Batman,"Alright. But it could be dangerous. You're sure there's nobody you want to call first? Friends, family... a husband, maybe?"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Batman,I'm sorry.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Batman,I saw him perform when I was younger. He was great.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Batman,I... just have that kind of face.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),TRAPPED,Batman,It's a trap!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),TRAPPED,Batman,I have an idea.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),TRAPPED,Batman,This way!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),TRAPPED,Batman,"Come on, the show's not over yet!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DEBUNKED,Batman,The only place you're heading is to a prison cell!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DEBUNKED,Batman,Take my hand!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DEBUNKED,Batman,Trust me Zanna.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DEBUNKED,Batman,"Quick, in my glove."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Batman,"I meant to, really..."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Batman,Shoot.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Batman,A painful memory... and a promise.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Batman,You too. Can I give you a ride?

1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE DYNAMIC DUO,Batman,"Let them go! He's all we need. - Now, who's behind this little enterprise?"
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE DYNAMIC DUO,Batman,Suit yourself. Let's go.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE DYNAMIC DUO,Batman,We're not the police. You want help? I want a name. Who's your boss!
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE DYNAMIC DUO,Batman,Marin?
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE DYNAMIC DUO,Batman,"Forget it, Robin."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE DYNAMIC DUO,Batman,"I said, forget it!"
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE DYNAMIC DUO,Batman,Let it go! The police can take it from here. Go get the Batmobile.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE DYNAMIC DUO,Batman,"Now! - All right, scumbucket. It's you, me and thirty storeys. You're gonna tell me exactly what I want to know."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE ARGUMENT,Batman,I'm working alone tonight.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE ARGUMENT,Batman,It's something I have to do alone.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE ARGUMENT,Batman,You know the rules. There are times I can’t explain...
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE ARGUMENT,Batman,We'll discuss this later!
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Batman,(Dick's voice in his mind
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Batman,"Now, about Zucco."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Batman,"Easy, Stromwell."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Batman,This isn't a social call. I've come for your nephew. Tony Zucco.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Batman,"I want him bad, Stromwell. Real bad."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Batman,"If you protect him, Stromwell, I'll be very... grumpy. You don't want to see me when I'm grumpy."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Batman,"I was so close, Alfred, I could smell his sweat. From now on, Tony Zucco gets my undivided attention."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Batman,I'm doing this for him.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,UPRISING,Batman,"Sorry Robin, but on this team, I call the shots."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,UPRISING,Batman,Batman out!
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FLASHBACK,Batman,"(Realizing that the Batmobile is being traced.) I told you to sit this one out, Robin."
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,"FLASHBACK, PART II",Batman,"Only place you're going is up the river, you scum!"
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,"FLASHBACK, PART II",Batman,Hang on!
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,"FLASHBACK, PART II",Batman,Home.
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,"FLASHBACK, PART II",Batman,"This is where I work. You're the first... correction, second person to see it."
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,"FLASHBACK, PART II",Batman,Because I want to know just how badly you want Tony Zucco.
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,ROBIN'S RECKONING,Batman,Robin! Enough. You can't let your emotions get the best of you!
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,ROBIN'S RECKONING,Batman,"It wasn't that, Robin. It wasn't that at all. Zucco's taken so much, caused you so much pain, I couldn't stand the thought that he might... Take you, too."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,THE SUMMONING,Batman,"What is it, Alfred?"
1,54,Day of the Samurai,THE SUMMONING,Batman,"Konnichiwa, sensei."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,OLD ENEMIES,Batman,"Let her go, ninja."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,OLD ENEMIES,Batman,Release Kairi!
1,54,Day of the Samurai,OLD ENEMIES,Batman,"First, she goes free. - <<Translated from Japanese>> Stay put!"
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Batman,Very.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Batman,I would prefer to be a samurai.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Batman,So it would seem.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Batman,All right. Take your best shot!
1,55,See No Evil,THE INVISIBLE MAN,Batman,Footseps? -- Who are you? I know you're in here!
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,Are you Giddell?
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,Where were you the day before yesterday?
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,"Working kind of late, aren't you?"
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,"This is that ""invisibility plastic"" your boss created?"
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,How does it work?
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,Mm-hmm
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,I know. I read the report.
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,So you were just going to dump it?
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Batman,Who else would know about this stuff?
1,55,See No Evil,LLOYD STRIKES AGAIN,Batman,Mrs. Ventrix? I'm looking for your husband. It's urgent.
1,55,See No Evil,LLOYD STRIKES AGAIN,Batman,...and prolongued exposure to the plastic can damage the mind as well as the body.
1,55,See No Evil,LLOYD STRIKES AGAIN,Batman,Who?
1,55,See No Evil,LLOYD STRIKES AGAIN,Batman,A tranquilizer dart. How long ago did you see your daughter.

1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN VS VENTRIX,Batman,"Peek-a-boo. - Get ready for your biggest disappearing act, Ventrix. The one where no one sees you for 10 to 20."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Batman,None. And I've scoured the entire city. No one's seen either Robin or Dick Grayson for two days!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Batman,You're Talia's father?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Batman,"I get the message. Okay then, for openers, look at the blade. It's used by a cult of mercenaries based in Calcutta. Even the rope appears to be made of a ..... indigenous to that area."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Batman,I think I'll call it 'strike one'.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Batman,"You still have me at a loss, Ra's al Ghul. Just how did you learn who I am?"
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Batman,"Next time, I'll have to glue my mask on. Do you need help?"
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Batman,I make it my business to know things like that. Here. There's an incense shop.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Batman,Okay. That's two!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Batman,YES! Unless you tell me how to find the mercenaries who did this!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Batman,Where?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Batman,Bruce Wayne donates millions of dollars a year to preserve these forests!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Batman,And you're the one who'll do the forcing?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Batman,"Sweet dreams, tabby."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Batman,"Maybe. Maybe not. Look at this! A map of the Hymalayas. There's a faint scratch, almost certainly made by a fingernail, tracing a route."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Batman,After you.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Batman,While I descend the hard way!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Batman,Pits?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Batman,All right. If that's the way it's to be played. -- Robin.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Batman,You okay?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Batman,I'll have you free in a minute. - Been here long?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Batman,I do. - Ra's al Ghul.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,Obviously your little accident wasn't fatal. I imagine you and Ubu left the chopper when I wasn't looking.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,Almost from the beginning. How could you have known that Robin and your daughter were abducted on the same night...
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,"Exactly. And do you think I would have let you take me anywhere in your plane unless I suspected you meant to lead me somewhere? For one thing, there were all those would-be assassins. They knew where we would be and when. Someone had to be tipping them off; that someone had to be you. Then there was Ubu, always by his master's side, always very picky about letting you go ahead of everyone else except in Malaysia where you knew there was danger waiting."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,Ready to go?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,I didn't ask for any. And that's three!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,He had funny way of showing it.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,Then it was a test? But why me?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,"Forget it! Then this means we must be enemies! You will regret this insult, Detective! You will--"
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,I've had it with your little games!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,Pulse is bad. He can't fake that!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,We have no choice. He stopped breathing!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Batman,"Put her down! I said, PUT HER DOWN!"
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,LAZARUS MADNESS,Batman,"Put her down, Ra's! NOW!"
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,LAZARUS MADNESS,Batman,I get it! I get it! - Stay back.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,LAZARUS MADNESS,Batman,The answer is still no.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,ORPHEUS,Batman,"Robin, the rope! - Come on! - You okay?"
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,ORPHEUS,Batman,Then we gotta find out where. He's going to realize his dream of a green and balanced Earth at any cost! Even if that means destroying half the planet's population to do it!
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,ORPHEUS,Batman,You were his prisoner for a week. You must have overheard something!
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Batman,Then let's do it!
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Batman,Too bad I can't say the same.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Batman,You have nothing to lose by telling me what you're doing here!
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Batman,How?
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Batman,Orpheous.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Batman,But that will cost countless lives!
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Batman,"Yes, I can see it clearly now for the first time... you are completely out of your mind."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,SHOWDOWN,Batman,If you only knew how sick I am of you calling me that.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,SHOWDOWN,Batman,"If you insist. - Give it up, Ra's. You'll destroy yourself!"
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,SHOWDOWN,Batman,Give me your hand!
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,SHOWDOWN,Batman,I know.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,SHOWDOWN,Batman,Looks that way.
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,FAKE EVIDENCE,Batman,I got a look at the evidence. Those deposit receipts were perfect forgeries. Dated months ago. Doesn't look like Thorne's handiwork.
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,FAKE EVIDENCE,Batman,"Word on the street is, a new syndicate is moving in. Could be a connection. I'll check it out. Anything you need?"
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,FAKE EVIDENCE,Batman,"Sorry, but there's more to this than a simple frame-up. And I'm not gonna find out by appearing in rallies."
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,FAKE EVIDENCE,Batman,The best thing you can do for him is to keep out of it. The people behind this are dangerous.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Batman,Do you mind?
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Batman,I don't know who you are or why you're doing this but let's get one thing straight
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Batman,You've already fouled up once. Stay out of our way so it doesn't happen again! - I should've known it would be Two-Face. It's a perfect two-part plan. He consolidates the gangs while Mason takes over the police.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Batman,"You saw him flip his coin. It's a judge, jury... and executioner."
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Batman,You first! Press here to send it back down to us.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Batman,I hope so.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Batman,I've got an idea.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Batman,We'll find out when we get there.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Batman,Most likely. We've got to get to Bayshore wharf.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,FINALE,Batman,Out there. On her own.
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,THE RALLY,Batman,No. Too easy to detect.
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,THE RALLY,Batman,Touchdown! - And the crowd goes wild.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,MADNESS,Batman',No! You're not real! -- Robin. Alfred. You've got to help me.
1,23,The Forgotten,BRUCE REMEMBERS AND ALFRED COMES TO THE RESCUE,Batwing,Negative.
1,23,The Forgotten,BRUCE REMEMBERS AND ALFRED COMES TO THE RESCUE,Batwing,"Impossible, area too confined."
1,23,The Forgotten,BRUCE REMEMBERS AND ALFRED COMES TO THE RESCUE,Batwing,Your funeral.
1,23,The Forgotten,BRUCE REMEMBERS AND ALFRED COMES TO THE RESCUE,Batwing,Caution! Rocks.

1,24,Mad as a Hatter,JERVIS TETCH,Bruce,"That's alright, Dr. Cates. Mr. Tetch is a valued member of our research team. I'm sure we can spare him more time."

1,26,The Clock King (episode),THE CLOCK KING,Bruce,It's nobody's fault. Look! The traffic signals are malfunctioning.
1,26,The Clock King (episode),THE CLOCK KING,Bruce,No. No it doesn't. And that maybe exactly the point.
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,I'm lucky to be awake at all! I fell under that trap like an amateur!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,How did I get back here? Robin?
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,"If this is a joke Alfred, it's not funny."
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,What?
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,It's not here!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,You know what I'm talking about! The entrance to the Batcave! Why is it sealed up!?
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,"That's right, Alfred. The Batcave. It's a big hole in the ground with a big car in it that's all black, remember?"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,"No! No, it's impossible! No! It can't be you! It can't be!"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,I-- I'm... alright... just partied to hard last night... that's all.
1,27,Perchance to Dream,AMATEUR,Bruce,Sure... I'm fine. Really.
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,"Alfred, will you do me a favor? It's an odd favor. . . Would you tell me about my life? Just humor me, please."
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,"That's alright, Alfred. Go on. Please."
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,No. It's wrong. It's all wrong!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,Selina?
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,Actually-- Yeah! Who-- who is he?
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,No-- I mean... who is he?
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,"Selina, does the name Catwoman ring a bell?"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,"I'm losing my mind, that's what!"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,"I couldn't go to a psychiatrist. You're the only doctor I trust, Leslie. It's like I'm living someone else's life! I don't know anything about me anymore! Help me, Leslie. Please."
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,Batman.
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,Then all this years of training and discipline... what happened to my parents!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,LIFE,Bruce,Then... the nightmare is over!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,"Dad! - Dad, will you and mom join Selina and me at the opera tonight?"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,"I've never felt better in my life, sir."
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,"Have you found that entrance to the Batcave yet, Alfred?"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,"Good! 'Cause if you had, then we'd both be nuts!"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,"Why shouldn't I be? My life is a dream, Alfred! The best dream anyone ever had."
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,"You do that, Alfred! (Bruce realizes he can't read) Wha?-- Ugghhh Nothing makes sense!"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,NO! You're a lie! It's all a lie!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,Batman! Always Batman!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,He's behind all this! I know it! And I'm'na find out why!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,I need a flare gun and some flares!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,"Certainly, officer."
1,27,Perchance to Dream,REAL,Bruce,Very well. But not right now!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,Here I am! I've been waiting for you! You did this to me!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,Liar! You know what's going on! This is a dream! And you're the one responsible!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,I suspected it from the start! I knew I was right when I tried to read the newspaper. The print didn't make sense.
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,That's because reading is a function of the right side of the brain. While dreams come from the left side. It's impossible to read something in a dream!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,"I can't explain it. But you're the key to this. I knew you'd be here. This tower is part of my nightly patrol. Now, tell me what's going on!"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,(takes off Batman's cowl) The Mad Hatter!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,Then you known everything about me!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,Then you're not the real Mad Hatter.
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,Make it stop! Bring me back!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,It's not real!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,THIS ISN'T SOME SILLY STORYBOOK!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,"NO! I won't live a lie, no matter how attractive you make it!"
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,Tell me how to wake up or I'll...
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,You're wrong! There IS a way out!
1,27,Perchance to Dream,DREAM,Bruce,Then I'll see you in your nightmares!
1,28,The Underdwellers,BATCAVE INVESTIGATION,Bruce,"Leprechauns, Alfred!"
1,28,The Underdwellers,BATCAVE INVESTIGATION,Bruce,"You think I'm crazy, don't you?"
1,28,The Underdwellers,BATCAVE INVESTIGATION,Bruce,Seriously. You don't believe I saw a leprechaun.
1,28,The Underdwellers,BATCAVE INVESTIGATION,Bruce,Maybe I need a rest.
1,28,The Underdwellers,BATCAVE INVESTIGATION,Bruce,Sounds boring.
1,28,The Underdwellers,BATCAVE INVESTIGATION,Bruce,"Hot and boring. No, Alfred. I think this is a job for Batman."
1,28,The Underdwellers,BATCAVE INVESTIGATION,Bruce,"Why, thank you, Alfred."
1,28,The Underdwellers,BATCAVE INVESTIGATION,Bruce,Yes. I think it's time for an encore.
1,29,Night of the Ninja,ATTACKS,Bruce,"Seventh. Where, Alfred?"
1,29,Night of the Ninja,ATTACKS,Bruce,If you'll excuse me.
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAST,Bruce,Huh? - I’m not good enough Yoru Sensei. I lost.
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAST,Bruce,"I have to be the best there is, no matter what it takes!"
1,29,Night of the Ninja,SUMMER,Bruce,I'll be at the museum. I should be back by midnight.
1,29,Night of the Ninja,SUMMER,Bruce,Good thing I decided to practice tonight. Yoru Sensei would hate to lose that blade! It's five hundred years old.
1,29,Night of the Ninja,SUMMER,Bruce,Why have you been following me all evening?
1,29,Night of the Ninja,SUMMER,Bruce,"It's late, Mrs. Gleeson."
1,29,Night of the Ninja,ROBIN TO THE RESCUE,Bruce,"I remember you, Kyodai."
1,29,Night of the Ninja,ROBIN TO THE RESCUE,Bruce,"As I remember it, being a thief was what got you thrown out in the first place."
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAYBACK,Bruce,"(Batman voice) Shut up and fight. -  You were right about one thing, Kyodai! Now it ends!"
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAYBACK,Bruce,That Batman arrived and took care of the ninja! That's true enough!
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAYBACK,Bruce,Ninjas are very resourceful.
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAYBACK,Bruce,"It doesn't matter. I defeated him once. If necessary, I could do it again!"
1,29,Night of the Ninja,PAYBACK,Bruce,Thanks for your help. It would've been harder to defeat him with Summer watching. Maybe even... impossible.
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,That's up to Dr. Hugo Strange. I think he's the same doctor Judge Vargas mentioned. My first session with him is in 15 minutes.
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,"Are you sure this will help me relax, doc?"
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,What defenses might those be?
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,Some secrets are worth keeping!
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,I don't have much to say about my childhood.
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,What happened to my parents is no secret!
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,I was only a child! There was nothing I could do!
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,I... wanted...
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,"REVENGE! -- Your... relaxation therapy doesn't seem to be working too well on me, Dr. Strange."
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,THERAPY,Bruce,"I'll have to think about it. Good day, doc."
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,STRANGE MACHINE,Bruce,"Good. This is my chance to get a closer look at his machine! I've got bad feelings about it, Alfred. (While he investigates the machine) Judge Vargas..."
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,STRANGE MACHINE,Bruce,It can see thoughts!
1,30,The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne,STRANGE ALLIES,Bruce,"Almost through, Alfred. Has Strange come back?"

1,33,Beware the Gray Ghost,THE SEARCH,Bruce,The Gray Ghost.
1,33,Beware the Gray Ghost,THE SEARCH,Bruce,You said you have everything.
1,33,Beware the Gray Ghost,THE SEARCH,Bruce,"So, The Gray Ghost doesn't exist?"
1,33,Beware the Gray Ghost,THE SEARCH,Bruce,So many actors.
1,33,Beware the Gray Ghost,THE SEARCH,Bruce,I found him!
1,33,Beware the Gray Ghost,THE SEARCH,Bruce,"And he's living right here, in Gotham!"
1,33,Beware the Gray Ghost,THE ANSWER,Bruce,"That's it! That's the noise! (after seeing the bombs are toy cars) You've got to be kidding me!

1,34,Cat Scratch Fever,TRIAL,Bruce,"Besides, I'm not totally convinced she's given up her criminal life!"
1,34,Cat Scratch Fever,WARNING,Bruce,"That's not important, Selina. You are."
1,34,Cat Scratch Fever,WARNING,Bruce,"I understand. Then, as a friend, may I point out that this arrest could revoke your probation?"
1,34,Cat Scratch Fever,WARNING,Bruce,"Roland Daggett is a dangerous man, Selina! I'd be very careful."
1,34,Cat Scratch Fever,WARNING,Bruce,What kind?
1,34,Cat Scratch Fever,WARNING,Bruce,"That goes without saying, doesn't it?"

1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,DAMAGE REPORT,Bruce,The design specs?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,DAMAGE REPORT,Bruce,"You're right. Ten minutes, Lucius. Thanks."
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,BARBARA GORDON,Bruce,Karl went into semi-seclusion after the loss of his daughter. He taught me everything I know about electronics. But he's been more active in business lately. I'll talk to him.
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,BARBARA GORDON,Bruce,"Barbara, come in! You've grown! It's been, what... four years?"
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,BARBARA GORDON,Bruce,And who's your little friend?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,Just curious if anyone's tried to sell you any wetware.
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,"Yes, thanks. I was wondering about your own AI research. - Thank you."
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,Who?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,H.A.R.D.A.C.! OK. And you?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,Your hand is like ice.
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,"So tell me, what does H.A.R.D.A.C. do?"
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,"Well, since you won't tell me what you're working on Karl, maybe I can charm the details out of your lovely assistant?"
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,Dinner? Tomorrow night in my house?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Bruce,"Good. Well, I better get going."
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,"As of last night, Carl Rossum hadn't been approached to receive any stolen goods, but he knew what was stolen."
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,"Well, ""squeeze"" may not be the best word."
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,Not at all.
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,Shall we go?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,"Yeah, Karl's a genius, alright. He'd have to be to know that was wetware chips that were stolen from my company. Care to tell me about that, Randa? (answering the phone) Wayne here. I'm on my way. I have to go out. Call Alfred if you need anything. I'll be back soon."
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,They get the wetware specs?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,They dust they keys for prints?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,Don't worry. I uploaded a decoy file here last night. The real design specs file is in my house.
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,I think it's time Miss Duane answered some questions.
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,"No answer at the house. I better get back there. See you later, Lucius."
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,Alfred? Randa? Alfred! Alfred?
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,"Alfred, what happened? Where's Ms. Duane?"
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,Bruce,"I assume nothing at this point. - Computer, scan Batcave for- what!?! (Screams as the episode ends)"
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,POLICE IMPOSTOR,Bruce,"I will, Commissioner. And thanks for--"

1,41,"If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?",AFTERMATH,Bruce,Bringing in $5.5 million a year in new jobs will do that.
1,41,"If You're So Smart, Why Aren't You Rich?",AFTERMATH,Bruce,"Maybe. But we've been searching for the Riddler for months and he's still out there. (Cut to Mockridge, who's clutching a gun, as he nervously tiptoes to bed)"
1,42,Joker's Wild,ASYLUM BREAKOUT,Bruce,No comment.
1,42,Joker's Wild,JOKER'S WILD,Bruce,Mine too. But I'm convinced it wasn't Kaiser's original goal to make a Joker themed casino. See?
1,42,Joker's Wild,JOKER'S WILD,Bruce,That's what I intend to find out.
1,42,Joker's Wild,JOKER'S WILD,Bruce,Why not?
1,42,Joker's Wild,JOKER'S WILD,Bruce,The secret's out. And you are...?
1,42,Joker's Wild,JOKER'S WILD,Bruce,Too bad it has to be in such gruesome surroundings.
1,42,Joker's Wild,JOKER'S WILD,Bruce,Not hardly. All those horrible faces grinning at me. That would do things to my mind after awhile.
1,42,Joker's Wild,JOKER'S WILD,Bruce,"Yeah, I'd be ready for the laughing academy if I had to stare at that ugly clown all day."
1,42,Joker's Wild,JOKER'S WILD,Bruce,Hit me.

1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE FLYING GRAYSONS,Bruce,What about the boy?
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE FLYING GRAYSONS,Bruce,I was in the audience. Couldn't leave after this. Does he have anyone?
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE FLYING GRAYSONS,Bruce,I may be able to help.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE FLYING GRAYSONS,Bruce,"Look Dick, it's not gonna be easy. You have to take it a day at a time. But for however long it takes, you have a home with us."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE FLYING GRAYSONS,Bruce,Bruce.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Bruce,"I'm afraid not tonight, Dick. I got a late meeting. Could be... fruitful."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Bruce,"Hey, Dick. How you doing?"
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Bruce,Sorry I haven't been around! I forget how big and lonely this place can be.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Bruce,"As it turn out, I may have some free time starting tomorrow. How'd you like to catch the Gotham Knights season opener? Box seats!"
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Bruce,I know it must be very difficult.
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Bruce,"I know. You keep thinking ""if only I'd done something differently. If only I could've... Warned them"". But there isn't anything you could have done. There isn't anything either of us could have done."
1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE SEARCH,Bruce,I wish I could say yes. But it'll get better in time... For you. That I promise.
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FLASHBACK,Bruce,Try using more control! You're wasting a lot of energy!
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FLASHBACK,Bruce,See? It's finesse; not strength.
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FLASHBACK,Bruce,"Hey! Okay, now you're gonna get it! Too slow, huh?"
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FLASHBACK,Bruce,"Um... why don't you hit the showers, Dick? It's almost time for dinner."
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FLASHBACK,Bruce,Oh.
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FLASHBACK,Bruce,How soon?
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FLASHBACK,Bruce,And if Zucco gets away?
1,54,Day of the Samurai,THE RETURN,Bruce,"So would I, Alfred. But .......... cannot be denied."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,THE RETURN,Bruce,"Of course I will help in any way I can, Sensei. But what made you think of calling me?"
1,54,Day of the Samurai,THE RETURN,Bruce,He was beaten by Batman.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,THE RETURN,Bruce,We've met.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,KIBA NO HOKO,Bruce,Come.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,KIBA NO HOKO,Bruce,"No thanks, Alfred."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,KIBA NO HOKO,Bruce,"It was not good news! I believe I will have that tea, Alfred. - Once upon a time, Alfred, five hundred years ago to be exact, there was a fighting master who learned how to manipulate the ki lines. The currents of life force. He called the art Kiba no Hoko. The Way of the Fang. It was such an efficient and terrible fighting art, that the master decided it was too dangerous to teach. A mere touch could render a man unconscious or cripple him. There was even a touch that was fatal. So the master hid the only copy of the instruction scroll for Kiba no Hoko in one of the thousand caves on the slopes of Mt. Kajiki. He told no one, but his eldest son. The location has been kept a family secret for five hundred years."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,KIBA NO HOKO,Bruce,"Is the great-great-great grandson of the man who created that forbidden art. And the only man who knows the location of the scroll. Yoru Sensei has no sons. When he leaves this world, the secret leaves with him."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,KIBA NO HOKO,Bruce,Yoru's star student. Kyodai wants to trade her for the knowledge of the Fang.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,KIBA NO HOKO,Bruce,"It's not that easy, Alfred. He's after Batman as well."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,KIBA NO HOKO,Bruce,He fought Bruce Wayne and Batman. Fighting styles are like fingerprints. Kyodai knows that we're the same man.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,OLD ENEMIES,Bruce,Did he give you instructions for the exchange?
1,54,Day of the Samurai,OLD ENEMIES,Bruce,If you give him a phoney map he wouldn't know the difference.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,OLD ENEMIES,Bruce,"Ai, Sensei. I'll see that the map is delivered."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,FINAL QUEST,Bruce,"I can only read bits and pieces, Sensei. Not enough to understand the techniques. It seems that age has destroyed the secrets of Kiba no Hoko."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,FINAL QUEST,Bruce,"I'm afraid not just yet, old friend."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,FINAL QUEST,Bruce,Kyodai has the part of the scroll that describes the O Unemuri touch.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,FINAL QUEST,Bruce,"It means big sleep. A better translation might be ""Eternal Sleep""."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,FINAL QUEST,Bruce,"it could be anywhere, then."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Bruce,Alfred? Alfred?
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Bruce,I believe the Batman intends to face him.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Bruce,Batman does as he will. But I'm fairly sure he'll choose to meet the ninja.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Bruce,"This was a poor choice for a battleground, Kyodai. The volcano may claim us all."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Bruce,"Leaving so soon, Kyodai?"
1,54,Day of the Samurai,RISE AND FALL,Bruce,"It's all over, Kyodai! Your precious technique doesn't work! -- Grab it! If you jump and I pull you can make it! Kyodai! The rope!"
1,54,Day of the Samurai,AFTERMATH,Bruce,"I don't know, Alfred. I wish I did."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,AFTERMATH,Bruce,No. I found his practice dummy. There was a soft spot on it. A place jabbed many times. I protected that spot on my own body!
1,54,Day of the Samurai,AFTERMATH,Bruce,"I'm sorry about Kyodai, Sensei."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,AFTERMATH,Bruce,Why? He's as much a ninja as Kyodai was.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,AFTERMATH,Bruce,"Domo Arigato, Sensei."
1,55,See No Evil,THE INVISIBILITY CLOAK,Bruce,But I seem to remember last year hearing something about an invisibility project.
1,55,See No Evil,THE INVISIBILITY CLOAK,Bruce,"So, what happened?"
1,55,See No Evil,THE INVISIBILITY CLOAK,Bruce,"Lucius, see if you can locate him. I'd like to talk to him."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Bruce,No! It can't be!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Bruce,Who are you? How did you get in here?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Bruce,The Demon's Head. I thought you were only a legend.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,ORPHEUS,Bruce,"Orpheus. From greek mythology. He descended into the netherworld to bring his beloved back from the dead. But according to the database, Orpheus is also the name of a privately owned satellite, launched into synchronous orbit over a year ago."

(Batman puts the gadget away and approaches the pump box) Oh, and I don't recommend trying to open the pump's housing. It's rigged with a vibration-sensitive explosive.

I designed him from scratch, so to speak. I gave him the strength and speed of a cat and more. I love cats. Their independence, their power and beauty.

1,31,"Tyger, Tyger",MAD SCIENCE,Dorian,"You don't. The clock is ticking, Batman. Good luck. You'll need it. - He's all yours, Tygrus. He is prey to you, my boy, of no more concern than a rabbit is to a wolf, and when he's gone, nothing will stand in your way."

1,32,Dreams in Darkness,DISTURBED,Dr. Bartholomew,"In your condition? Uh-huh. I can't allow that! You're staying here! - You're still very ill, Batman. This will make you feel better."

1,22,Prophecy of Doom,BRUCE'S TRANSFORMATION,Ethan,Hm-mh A miracle has happened! Bruce has seen the light!
1,22,Prophecy of Doom,BRUCE'S TRANSFORMATION,Ethan,"Nostromos, I was thinking; a man of Bruce's standing, his influence... should he not be considered for the brotherhood?"

1,22,Prophecy of Doom,THE GREAT DECEPTION,Ethan,Nostromos... what is this? I- I don't understand!
1,22,Prophecy of Doom,THE GREAT DECEPTION,Ethan,Why would you do this? I believed in you! You saved me! Please Nostrom--
1,22,Prophecy of Doom,THE GREAT FALL... OF NOSTROMOS,Ethan,I can't believe I was so gullible! But that's what I get for putting my faith in greed.

1,50,Robin's Reckoning Part I,THE FLYING GRAYSONS,Gordon,This is it! I'll get your bags.

1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,FAKE EVIDENCE,Gordon,I was wondering when you'd get around to me.
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,FAKE EVIDENCE,Gordon,Then who?
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,FAKE EVIDENCE,Gordon,Yes. Check on Barbara. Keep her out of this.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Gordon,What in...?
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,FINALE,Gordon,"You're sick, Gil! A lot sicker than him! At least I can see his bad half!"

1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,H.A.R.D.A.C.,The information I need was not in that file. Search the house. My data banks of Rossum's memories indicate that Bruce Wayne always kept important backups at home.
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,THE TRUTH,H.A.R.D.A.C.,Intriguing. This data may be useful later. There must be a central computer that will have the data I need.

1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,H.A.R.D.A.C.,People are imperfect. They make mistakes. Your mistake was coming here to interfere with the plan.
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,H.A.R.D.A.C.,The plan was conceived by Karl Rossum when his young daughter was... deactivated.
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,H.A.R.D.A.C.,"A vehicular accident. Our maker felt the emotion called ""love"" in great quantity for her. Afterwards he decided to find a way to replace humans whose decisions can cost other human lifes."
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,H.A.R.D.A.C.,"Precisely! The maker's concept was sound, but he did not go far enough which is why I have taken over."
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,H.A.R.D.A.C.,No. There's still much to learn from humans. I will keep them alive until I have learned enough.

1,13,P.O.V.,THE INTERROGATION ROOM: VEREDICT,Hackle,How touching! I hope you're as good at defending yourself. Since the detective here is calling you a liar!
1,13,P.O.V.,THE INTERROGATION ROOM: VEREDICT,Hackle,"Well, someone in here is lying."
1,13,P.O.V.,THE INTERROGATION ROOM: VEREDICT,Hackle,"Alright, let's have your version."

1,13,P.O.V.,THE INTERROGATION ROOM: VEREDICT,Hackle,So you're accusing the detective of trying to (hog probaly incorrect) the collar!
1,13,P.O.V.,THE INTERROGATION ROOM: VEREDICT,Hackle,You're all suspended! Until I make my decision.

1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Joker,Coming to your local store! Just as soon as that nasty old G. Carl Francis decides to give me my legal cut of the profits!
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Joker,"I hope you've changed your mind, Mr. Francis. Because I haven't changed mine!"
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE LAUGH,Joker,"This just in. Former copyright director G. Carl Francis will be taking an extended vacation. Looks like he's having more fun already! But I'm not happy! If I don't get legal claim to my fish by 3 AM, the number 2 bureaucrat Thomas Jackson will feel my wrath! And now, Batman, 'cause I know you're watching, here's a message from our sponsors!"
1,46,The Laughing Fish,THE BAIT,Joker,"Whooo! Look at what I caught! Kind of ....., though. I'm gonna have to throw it back! - You know, Bullock, you may be a lousy cop, but you make a terrific worm!"

1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Joker,"Gee; and let my little guppy go hungry? I don't know... What do you think we can do about that! -- You're right, Harley. Fish are disgusting. I think I'll start using my toxin on cattle. Joker Burgers! Ha! Talk about a happy meal! ... You never could take a joke!"
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Joker,Yeah... catch!
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Joker,Oopsie!
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Joker,"Meanwhile, back at the wrench! Since my side-splitters don't tickle you, how 'bout a skull-splitter?"
1,46,The Laughing Fish,"THE BAT, THE SHARK AND THE CLOWN",Joker,See Batsy! I think of everything! (Jumps to the ocean... where the shark is waiting)

1,47,Harley and Ivy,NO MAN,Joker,"Oh, Pammy, I wouldn't leave you empty handed. Since you like flowers so much."

1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE JOKER,Joker,"Any questions, Murph?"
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE JOKER,Joker,"Good man! And if Batman hasn't really gone to his final reward, we'll see that he gets there! Hahahaha...."
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE AMBUSH,Joker,"Where is he? He's never been this late before. There's a certain rhythm to these things. I cause trouble, he shows up, we have some laughs, and the game starts all over again. Only now thanks to you... I have this terrible feeling he's really not coming..."
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE AMBUSH,Joker,"Put them back, Harley."
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE AMBUSH,Joker,"I said, put them back!"
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE AMBUSH,Joker,"Without Batman, crime has no punchline."
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE AMBUSH,Joker,"Dear friends...Today is the day that the clown cried. - And he cries not for the passing of one man, but for the death of a dream. The dream that he would someday taste the ultimate victory over his hated enemy. For it was the Batman who made me the happy soul I am today. How I agonized over the perfect way to thank him for that. Perhaps with a cyanide pie in the face. - Or an exploding whoopee cushion playfully planted in the Batmobile. - But those dreams were dashed by the weaselly little gunsel sitting there in our midst. The cowardly insignificant ganef who probably got lucky when Batman slipped on the slime trail this loser left behind him. This mound of diseased hyena filth who's not fit to lick the dirt from my spats!... But I digress. The time for sorrow has passed. It's time to look ahead to a future filled with smiles. And I'll be smiling again just as soon as we take that man there and slap him in that box there, and roll him into that vat of acid there!"
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE AMBUSH,Joker,"(sighs heavily) Well, that was fun! Who's for Chinese?"

1,36,Almost Got 'Im,AVIARY OF DOOM,Penguin,"Beautiful, aren't they? Like glittering fragments of the rainbow. By the way, that mist I sprayed on you, is derived from the nectar these birds drink!

1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,SHOWDOWN,Ra's,My children! We stand on the threshold of a great adventure! Even now the satellite Orpheus is moving into proper alignment and the moment of destiny is finally upon us.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,LAZARUS MADNESS,Ra's,"A pity. You leave me no choice. - You see, if you aren't with me, Detective, you are against me."
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA'S BETRAYAL,Ra's,"Then choose a target and test it, Daughter. We must be certain it has survived its ordeal, intact."
1,44,Off Balance,TALIA'S BETRAYAL,Ra's,"So even in defeat, the detective manages to achieve some small measure of victory. As you said, detective... ""This is not over."""
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Ra's,"You must forgive Ubu, detective. He is well trained. Allow me to introduce myself. I am he who is called Ra's al Ghul."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Ra's,"I am quite real. And as I'm sure you realize by now, my reputation for resourcefulness is well-deserved. AS you can see, we have a common problem. Your ward was abducted on the same night as my daughter. You do remember my daughter?"
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Ra's,"Yes. But surely you did not expect her to mention me by name... Keep your distance! I am merely old, older perhaps than you can imagine, but not so old that I cannot assist you in your search."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Ra's,"Well done, Detective. You are worthy of your reputation. To India then! Come, I have an aircraft waiting!"
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,RA'S AL GHUL,Ra's,Forgive my servant. He feels that no one should proceed me. Call it over zealousness.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Ra's,"I control a vast global organization, Detective. Obviously Batman's activities require certain costly implements. It was a simple matter for my people to learn which wealthy Americans were amassing what Batman might require. The one who matched my daughter's description of you was Bruce Wayne."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Ra's,"I need nothing. As Napoleon told me, ""A strong will can fuel a frail physique""."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Ra's,"How can you be certain, Detective? That those we seek are to be found here?"
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,CALCUTTA,Ra's,Yes.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Ra's,"Look at it, Detective! One of the last rainforests. The world depends upon its oxygen, yet the rich see only profit in its destruction. You, who belong to the overclass, have much to answer for."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Ra's,"Which are being depleted at the rate of one hundred and twenty thousand acres a day! Does your money solve this problem? No! It would take more than wealth. It would take power! And I fear, ruthlessness! Humankind must be forced to serve the planet instead of its own appetites."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Ra's,"I am... qualified, yes. But I may not have sufficient lifetime left to me."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Ra's,"In the shadow of the volcano, just as the indian said. Let us hurry, the next piece of our puzzle surely awaits within!"
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Ra's,"Congratulations Detective, on thwarting our tormentors. Obviously our quest was meant to end here."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,MALAYSIA,Ra's,Indeed. I am familiar with that area and the nearest field is large enough to accomodate my aircraft from a hundred miles from our destination. So I will arrange for a helicopter when one is needed.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Ra's,The mountain in question is directly ahead. I ........ for my men. They'll wait me on the mountaintop.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Ra's,You must search for clues. If we perceive any danger we can signal you with...
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE DEMON'S HEAD,Ra's,"Ignore him, Detective. We must stay on the hunt for the sake of the children."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Ra's,"Indeed. The moment it exploded it was proceding in automatic pilot. So, how long have you known, Detective, that I planned your ward's capture?"
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Ra's,Unless I had done the abducting?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Ra's,I am deeply impressed.
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Ra's,My time is short. I have no sons. I need a man to assume my possition once I am gone!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Ra's,Because you are most worthy. That is now proven beyond any doubt. And because my precious daughter loves you!
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,LAZARUS MADNESS,Ra's,"But even a miracle such as the Lazarus Pit, has it's terrible prize."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,LAZARUS MADNESS,Ra's,"And no man may reap it's blessings indefinitely. Which is why I must ask you again, Detective, will you wed my daughter and carry on for me when I am gone?"
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,LAZARUS MADNESS,Ra's,He has seen too many of our secrets! He knows too much to be permitted to leave here.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,LAZARUS MADNESS,Ra's,"Only a minor loss. There is nothing here that cannot be found in our desert stronghold. And we must leave nothing behind that may be later used against us. - Farewell, Detective."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Ra's,"Enough! What is the meaning of this disturbance, Ubu?"
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Ra's,Oh? I believe I would have a closer look at one so foolish. Or so brave.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Ra's,"My admiration for you was well founded, Detective."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Ra's,"No. For now only relieve him of that cumbersome belt. Oh, and search him. Make certain that he conceals no surprises which might enable him to escape."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Ra's,"Yes, I suppose I do owe you that much, Detective, since in many ways you are responsible for it. You see, I had hoped to achieve my vision of an Earthly utopia, gradually over time, with my heir, carrying on my work after I was gone. But your refusal to become my heir has left me no other choice."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Ra's,"No, leave it. It is a mark of honor. Even though, because of him I must now use what I call the Lazarus Effect, to achieve my utopia in one bold stroke."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Ra's,"The material of the pit is an unknown chemical stew that bubbles to the Earth's surface only at certain key places. Even now my people are placing bombs, such as that one, over the various Lazarus Pits around the world. These bombs are electronically linked to a private satellite already in Earth orbit."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Ra's,"Precisely. And at the moment when sun and moon are in proper alignment to cause the greatest upheaval in Earth's geomagnetic field, I shall send a signal to that satellite beginning a countdown. Five minutes thereafter, one bomb will be lowered deep into the heart of each pit. The satellite will in turn relay a microwave signal that will detonate all the bombs simultaneously. The multiple explosions will result in a global chain reaction. All the Lazarus pits throughout the world will overflow.

1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Robin,"Well, if you say so, though, it was just starting to get interesting."
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Robin,You want us to put him in that!? You're crazy!
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Robin,Batman?
1,56,The Demon's Quest Part I,THE LAZARUS PIT,Robin,We've killed him.
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,ORPHEUS,Robin,"Sure. I wish I'd worn the thermal tights but other than that -- By the time we get down this mountain, he could be halfway to his desert stronghold... wherever that is."
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,ORPHEUS,Robin,But where do we even start looking?
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,ORPHEUS,Robin,"Well, there was one thing... a word I heard several times... it was Or... O-orf... Orpheus! Yeah, that's it!"
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,DESERT STRONGHOLD,Robin,"We're within one hundred kilometers of the target area, Bruce. Gotta hold it steady at five hundred feet to stay under their radar, but you can still eject at this altitude!"
1,57,The Demon's Quest Part II,SHOWDOWN,Robin,"So, it's finally over? We've seen the last of Ra's al Ghul?"
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,THE RALLY,Robin,Will you at least wear a transceiver? I can monitor from here in case they try to-
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,THE RALLY,Robin,"Hey, I didn't miss a Bogart festival in film class, just to sit on my butt here while you hit the streets! There has to be something I can do!"
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,THE RALLY,Robin,Showtime! Bruce? What in...?
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,THE RALLY,Robin,"Wait! - A girl?? - The lady's with me, gents. - Are you crazy? You're lucky you didn't get killed!"
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,THE RALLY,Robin,"This is nuts! - Great, she's gone too! Funny, I don't remember a Batgirl in our little club."
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,"With Gil Mason. The videotape clearly shows that he ducked before those shots were fired. If he knew that he was going to be shot at, he probably knows a lot more about what's going on."
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,"I hope so, Alfred, because if this lead fizzles, then I'm fresh out of ideas."
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,"You again! Listen, under other circumstances this could be fun, but I got a job to do!"
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,"Well, I don't have time to baby-sit amateurs, okay?"
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,"What are you doing here, anyway?"
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,Shh!
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,"Well, show's over. You can run along home now."
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,Okay?
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,UNLIKELY ALLIANCES,Robin,Good. You've got some sense after all.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Robin,Just whose side are you on?
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Robin,Me? I thought she was with you! She's got your taste in clothes! Speaking of which...
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Robin,And here we sit with no way to... huh? Sounds like a train!
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Robin,Not bad... maybe there's hope for you after all. - Hurry Batman!
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Robin,Always carry a spare!
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DEATH TRAP,Robin,Wait! Just in case you run into trouble up there!
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Robin,Think she made it?
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Robin,Think we'll make it?
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Robin,It's about time! - Where we going?
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Robin,Subways are getting more dangerous everyday! You think they got the Commissioner by now.
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,DOUBLE SETUP,Robin,"Glad it's not far, I hate wet shoes!"
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,FINALE,Robin,Missed me?
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,FINALE,Robin,Where's Batgirl?
1,47,Harley and Ivy,HUNTING THE LADIES,Rocco,"You ..... her, Boss. Remember?"
1,47,Harley and Ivy,HUNTING THE LADIES,Rocco,Gee... I-I guess you ain't seen the papers then.
1,47,Harley and Ivy,NO MAN,Rocco,She's right boss! I'm feeling kinda-- sick!
1,4,Feat of Clay Part I,ROLAND DAGGETT,Roland Daggett,"You sure, Bell? You sure that the man you hired knows nothing of our operation? Bell, I asked you a question! Bell! Bell! - Germs, take off his headphones."
1,5,Feat of Clay Part II,CLAYFACE,Roland Daggett,"Good. But I'm afraid we still got quite a mess to clean up. Sooner or later I will take control of Wayne Enterprises. Their marketing operation will instantly give me a distribution network that would take me years to build on my own. Till then, my takeover plans have to be... revised. Now that our actor friend, Hagen, is no longer available to us."
1,12,Appointment in Crime Alley,DAGGET'S PLAN,Roland Daggett,You did a good work mister... What did you say your name was?
1,34,Cat Scratch Fever,EVIL SCHEME,Roland Daggett,"Good, Milo! Remember, speed is of the essence. I expect this operation to be completed by tomorrow night."
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Rommulus,"And end you expect me to deliver. Milo, you're a worse animal than anything that I turn into."
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,THE BAIT,Romulus,"Been busy, Bruce. Trying to find a new tax shelter, or two."
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,THE BAIT,Romulus,"Dead serious. I'll give two and a half million to the Gotham United Fund, provided the Batman comes to the house personally to pick up the check."
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,THE BAIT,Romulus,"Well, let's just say I always wanted to check out Gotham's second best athlete first hand!"
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,THE TRAP,Romulus,Batman.
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,THE TRAP,Romulus,"I've been expecting you. Please, make yourself comfortable. I'll write you a check. Would you care for something to drink?"
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,THE TRAP,Romulus,"Hot? Why, no! I don't believe so."
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Romulus,"I hope so, Milo. The rain'll make me feel cleaner after what we just did."
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Romulus,"....... pigs's eye, Milo! There's only one thing I want from you!"
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Romulus,As if I haven't suffered enough?
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Romulus,"""Too late, professor. The power is mine now."""
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Romulus,"""Why should I give you a dime? It was my own sweat that got me this far, Milo! And I intend to go the rest of the way... alone!"""
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Romulus,"""What?"""
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Romulus,""" What did you do to me? The pain! The pain!"""
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,FULL MOON,Romulus,"I won't let you trick me again, Milo. Now, give me that antidote! Please! Just a taste!"
1,37,Moon of the Wolf,THE WOLF,Romulus,You fool! There's no telling what the werewolf might do!
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Rossum,"Afraid not. If anyone does, of course, you'll be the first to know. Cappuccino?"
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Rossum,Nothing like a hot cappuccino and a foot massage. Now let me show you my pride and joy. This is my greatest achievement. My prototype AI. This is H.A.R.D.A.C..
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Rossum,"How rude of me! Bruce, this is Randa Duane, my assistant!"
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Rossum,"Now Bruce, I can't tell you all of my secrets, can I? Let's just say that certain... uh... that certain... projects are under his control."
1,39,Heart of Steel Part I,HARDAC,Rossum,I'll walk you out.
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,HARDAC TAKES OVER,Rossum,"No, it was a stupid idea, the babblings of a broken heart!"
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,HARDAC TAKES OVER,Rossum,I've let this go too far. I gave you too much free will. It's time to change your programming.
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,Rossum,My office has an elevator on a separate power source. This way.
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,Rossum,Over there!
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,Rossum,I had no idea H.A.R.D.A.C. could go on this far.
1,40,Heart of Steel Part II,THE HEROINE,Rossum,"Miss Gordon, your skill at breaking and entering is impressive. Where did you learn those tricks?"
1,6,It's Never Too Late,THE SET-UP,Rupert Thorne,Stromwell wants the meeting tonight. We'll put up a sign that says private party.
1,17,Two-Face Part I,RUPERT THORNE'S PLAN,Rupert Thorne,"Yeah, crazy like a fox. That little tantrum probably bought him another 10,000 votes."
1,18,Two-Face Part II,THORNE'S CONTRACT,Rupert Thorne,(after learning of Two-Face's attack) How much did he take me for this time?
1,21,Vendetta,INTERROGATING THORNE,Rupert Thorne,(After Batman has broken through his greenhouse window) You'd better have the money to pay for that.
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE MASTERMIND,Rupert Thorne,Send him in.
1,59,Shadow of the Bat Part I,THE FALL OF THORNE,Rupert Thorne,"Maybe you'd prefer moving contraband in broad daylight, when the cops might notice."
1,24,Mad as a Hatter,SHOWDOWN IN WONDERLAND,Sad Hatter,"Would not, could not. Would not, could not... oh, could not join the dance."
1,23,The Forgotten,THE SLAVERY CAMPMENT,Salvo,"Hey, stranger."
1,23,The Forgotten,THE SLAVERY CAMPMENT,Salvo,"Well, opinions differ, but we all agree it ain't Miami."
1,23,The Forgotten,THE SLAVERY CAMPMENT,Salvo,"So, what's your name, pal?"
1,23,The Forgotten,THE SLAVERY CAMPMENT,Salvo,"If it's moving, it's a rat. If not, it's a cooked rat."
1,23,The Forgotten,ALFRED INVESTIGATES AND BRUCE'S NIGHTMARE,Salvo,I was one of the Gotham City's unemployed. Now I got a job! .... Lucky me...
1,23,The Forgotten,ALFRED INVESTIGATES AND BRUCE'S NIGHTMARE,Salvo,Cave in!
1,23,The Forgotten,ALFRED INVESTIGATES AND BRUCE'S NIGHTMARE,Salvo,I'm over here! Taking five...
1,23,The Forgotten,ALFRED INVESTIGATES AND BRUCE'S NIGHTMARE,Salvo,Take your time! It's the first break I've had all day!
1,23,The Forgotten,ALFRED INVESTIGATES AND BRUCE'S NIGHTMARE,Salvo,Too often.
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Salvo,"Thanks, Riley. Maybe this time we can find some work that pays."
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Salvo,"Hit me, Riley."
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Salvo,Maybe I'll lose my memory and wake up a millionaire too.
1,23,The Forgotten,BATMAN CAPTURES THE BAD GUYS AND AFTERMATH,Salvo,Master Bruce?
1,23,The Forgotten,THE SLAVERY CAMPMENT,Salvo,"Hey, Riley! (Wakes up Dan Riley)"
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,What do you want?
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,Here! All day! And I can prove it! The building security saw me! You can check!
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,I wanted to prep the last of the stuff for disposal.
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,Mm-hmm
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,"Here, let me show you. It's really quite remarkable. See those filaments embedded in the plastic?"
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,Run an electrical current through them and the stuff bends light instead of absorbing it so you can't see it. But in the process the plastic becomes toxic.
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,I've spent the last two months trying to correct the problem but it's hopeless.
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,"Yes, it's too dangerous. Funny thing is, some of it seems to be missing."
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,"Only the other assistant. Actually, he was more like an errand boy - an ex-conn. Name's Ventrix. Lloyd Ventrix."
1,55,See No Evil,BATMAN PAYS GIDDELL A VIST,Sam,"Okay you, come out of there! I don't know what you think you're doing! -- You?! I didn't know."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,FEAR,Scarecow,"Of course! And now that he's been exposed to the gas, he's achieved a fate he truly deserves."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,MADNESS,Scarecow,Excellent! The opportunities to study the nature of fear would be unparalleled. It's time for the greatest controlled experiment in mass-madness to finally begin!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW STRIKES AT THE UNIVERSITY'S BANK,Scarecrow,"I merely helped him visualize his innermost terror, which is obviously arachnophobia."
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW STRIKES AT THE UNIVERSITY'S BANK,Scarecrow,"Arachnophobia. Fear of spiders, you dimwitted dropout! Now to the vault! (bombs the vault open) Nigel, you'll stand guard here."
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW STRIKES AT THE UNIVERSITY'S BANK,Scarecrow,"Take what you can, then burn the rest."
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW STRIKES AT THE UNIVERSITY'S BANK,Scarecrow,This isn't about money...it's about revenge!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW STRIKES AT THE UNIVERSITY'S BANK,Scarecrow,(talking to Anthony) Climb up there and wait for my signal.
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW STRIKES AT THE UNIVERSITY'S BANK,Scarecrow,"Welcome, Batman!--Oh...a gas mask...perhaps you are as resourceful as they say."
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW STRIKES AT THE UNIVERSITY'S BANK,Scarecrow,I am fear incarnate. I am the terror of Gotham. I am the Scarecrow!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW STRIKES AT THE UNIVERSITY'S BANK,Scarecrow,"Except through you! (signals Anthony and the thug drops on Batman starting a fight. Scarecrow doses Batman with fear gas) Fight all you want, Batman; but you must succumb to the fear! What hidden terror keeps the Batman awake at night? -- Come on you creeps, my work is done!"
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S BACKGROUND STORY AT HIS HIDEOUT,Scarecrow,It seems I have underestimated the Batman; but at least the University is finished.
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S BACKGROUND STORY AT HIS HIDEOUT,Scarecrow,They tried to destroy me!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S BACKGROUND STORY AT HIS HIDEOUT,Scarecrow,"(grabbing Nigel's broken nose) No, you simpleton!"
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S BACKGROUND STORY AT HIS HIDEOUT,Scarecrow,"I taught there! I was a professor of psychology, specializing in phobias. Inducing terror has always intrigued me. Even as a boy, I loved to frighten things. People, animals, it was all the same. I became obsessed with fear's crippling power. Later, when I became their leading professor of subliminal psychology at the university, I began performing experiments on fear and its subsequent effects. Dr. Long thought I went too far. He called me a lunatic. So now, they will learn the true nature of horror!"
1,10,Nothing to Fear,AT THE CHARITY EVENT IN THE GOTHAM MUSEUM,Scarecrow,"Thank you, Dr. Long. I'll take that. (Takes the suitcase with the money from the charity)"
1,10,Nothing to Fear,AT THE CHARITY EVENT IN THE GOTHAM MUSEUM,Scarecrow,If you insist! (Sprays fear gas on Dr. Long)
1,10,Nothing to Fear,AT THE CHARITY EVENT IN THE GOTHAM MUSEUM,Scarecrow,(Laughs) Bring him! His torture has just begun.
1,10,Nothing to Fear,AT THE CHARITY EVENT IN THE GOTHAM MUSEUM,Scarecrow,Batman! I am surprised! I thought you'd be in home enjoying my time release fear toxin. Ha ha ha ha. (the crowd is scared of Batman) Welcome to everyone's worst fear! Isn't that invigorating!?
1,10,Nothing to Fear,AT THE CHARITY EVENT IN THE GOTHAM MUSEUM,Scarecrow,Marvelous. Simply marvelous!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S ESCAPE ON THE ZEPPELIN,Scarecrow,"Ha ha ha! My revenge is complete! The university is in the grip of fear, and Batman has been annihilated."
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S ESCAPE ON THE ZEPPELIN,Scarecrow,Annihilated! Destroyed! Dead!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S ESCAPE ON THE ZEPPELIN,Scarecrow,"I don't believe it! Anthony, take care of him!"
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S ESCAPE ON THE ZEPPELIN,Scarecrow,Do it!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S ESCAPE ON THE ZEPPELIN,Scarecrow,Do something!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S ESCAPE ON THE ZEPPELIN,Scarecrow,I believe we can leave it to my fear toxin.
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S ESCAPE ON THE ZEPPELIN,Scarecrow,No! -- Stop him!
1,10,Nothing to Fear,SCARECROW'S ESCAPE ON THE ZEPPELIN,Scarecrow,"Only for you and the doctor, Batman! (jumps into glider and flies away laughing)"
1,10,Nothing to Fear,BATMAN DISCOVERS CRANE AND THE FINAL CONFRONTATION,Scarecrow,It's not fair! Revenge was withing my grasp... I was so close! (takes off his mask and notices a gas leak. He is infected by the fear gas and the lights turn off) What's going on? Who's there? (Starts hallucinating with a giant bat) AAHHH! No! Please! (Stumbles into Batman) No! Stop! Leave me alone!
1,19,Fear of Victory,MR. LUCKY,Scarecrow,"It's no joke, I assure you. It's the fear of victory, and the agony of... (Lackey grabs him and reveals his true form) the Scarecrow! So now you understand step one in how I fix an athletic contest. I shall proceed to step two..."
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Scarecrow,"There's enough powder in that helmet to panic a pachyderm! (Another great play) He should be prostrating himself, crying for mercy!"
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Scarecrow,You!
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Scarecrow,"I need the money, Batman. You know the cost of chemicals these days. (pulls a test-tube of fear toxin out of his pocket and dangles it above the crowd below) And it will take much more than this to bring every pathetic person in Gotham to their knees, kissing my feet! (Batman continues to move towards him) No closer, Batman, unless you want a stampede of half-crazed humanity crushing and clawing each other!"
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Scarecrow,Now... What guarantee do I have that you won't follow me?
1,19,Fear of Victory,GAME NIGHT,Scarecrow,"At truly, Batman? I prefer a little insurance that should be otherwise occupied."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Scarecrow,"(through a camera) Superlative, Torchy. Precisely on schedule."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,EXPOSED,Scarecrow,"aha-- Precisely on schedule. Now, Torchy."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,FEAR,Scarecrow,Excellent! Keep going. I expect no interference.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,FEAR,Scarecrow,"Batman... is no longer of consequence. It was no accident his turning up at the Health Spa, you know. I'd leave rumors of a burglary up there."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,FEAR,Scarecrow,"Oh, he's much worse than that! Much, much worse than that."
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,MADNESS,Scarecrow,The great Batman scared out of his mind. How does it feel?
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,PAYBACK,Scarecrow,An entire city screaming in fear. I wonder if we'll be able to hear it.
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,PAYBACK,Scarecrow,"Get him! He's been exposed to the gas, remember? He'll be terrified of you! -- Fool! Did you really think I wouldn't have backup controls?"
1,32,Dreams in Darkness,PAYBACK,Scarecrow,No! NO!! HELP ME!!!...

1,55,See No Evil,THE INVISIBILITY CLOAK,Scientist,"I understand your concern, Mr. Wayne, but I don't think you need to worry that WayneTech is responsible for this ""invisible man"". After all, no equipment is missing."
1,55,See No Evil,THE INVISIBILITY CLOAK,Scientist,"Aha. The cloak of invisibility, he called it, right?"
1,55,See No Evil,THE INVISIBILITY CLOAK,Scientist,Don't bother. He passed away a couple of months ago.

1,10,Nothing to Fear,CONFRONTATION WITH BULLOCK,Security Guard,"He's right...(coughs)...it was some guy dressed like a scarecrow. He tried to torch the bank, but Batman stopped him."

1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,ENTER SELINA KYLE,Selina,Please understand it's purely for the animals Mr. Wayne. You're off the hook.
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,ENTER SELINA KYLE,Selina,I beg your pardon?
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,ENTER SELINA KYLE,Selina,"Alright, lunch then."
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,THE DATE...,Selina,"I'd rather it were Batman. You should have seen him, Maven. He had the eyes of a lion."
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,THE DATE...,Selina,Here we go.
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,THE DATE...,Selina,"Yes, I know. I suppose you're right. Still I wish it were Batman standing behind this door. Bruce, how wonderful to see you! Please, come in!"
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,THE DATE...,Selina,I'll just put these in some water.
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,THE DATE...,Selina,"What! Give me that! Martin, what happened! - That's ridiculous! You tell him I wanna meet with him! - No, today! You can't sell to Multigon, we had an agreement!"
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,THE DATE...,Selina,What? - What do you mean he won't take your calls? - You go there and kick down that door if yo have to! I want that land for the mountain lions! (Hangs the phone) Ohh. I'm afraid I'm not going to be very good company.
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,THE DATE...,Selina,Not really. Unless you can get me a meeting with the chairman of Multigon International.
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,THE DATE...,Selina,"Hey, I'm starting to like this guy."
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,...AT MULTIGON,Selina,That's insane! The land's in the middle of nowhere! It's worthless except to wildcats!
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,...AT MULTIGON,Selina,"You'll find more time for me, Mr. Stern. Before I'm through I'll have every environmental group and animal rights activist breathing down your neck. They'll be looking at you and your project so closely, you'll feel like a bug in a bell-jar."
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,...AT MULTIGON,Selina,"Well at least now I now what their cover story is. -- You know, it's awfully late for lunch. Would you mind if I took a rain check on our date? Please."
1,1,The Cat and the Claw Part I,...AT MULTIGON,Selina,Thanks! That'll give me time to take care of some business tonight!

We have to the count of five to get clear. And it will be all over for Arnold Stromwell."
1,6,It's Never Too Late,IN WAR AND LOVE,Thorne,"Hi, Arnie. I'm glad we could get together!"
1,6,It's Never Too Late,IN WAR AND LOVE,Thorne,"Don't you wish we could talk alone, man to man? Let the boys get some air. (All thugs leave the place) We made the news today."
1,6,It's Never Too Late,IN WAR AND LOVE,Thorne,"Come on, Arnie! This town is big enough for the two of us!"
1,6,It's Never Too Late,IN WAR AND LOVE,Thorne,What?
1,6,It's Never Too Late,IN WAR AND LOVE,Thorne,I don't know anything about it!
1,6,It's Never Too Late,IN WAR AND LOVE,Thorne,"I didn't touch your kid! I swear it Arnie! You know I don't mess with family! (Stromwell let go of him) Hey... Come on! He, we're awaken with the wrong foot here! It's a shame about your kid. Maybe I can help."
1,6,It's Never Too Late,IN WAR AND LOVE,Thorne,"Well, I've got connections you don't! (Stromwell agrees and sits down) Good. Now, we can't talk with an empty stomach. Pete! I wanna see now a pasta out here that would knock our stocks off."

1,17,Two-Face Part I,RUPERT THORNE'S PLAN,Thorne,"Just stay on his tail, Candice. All men have something to hide. The brighter the picture, the darker the negative."
1,17,Two-Face Part I,CALM BEFORE THE STORM,Thorne,"Congratulations, Harvey! This is Thorne. Rupert Thorne."
1,17,Two-Face Part I,CALM BEFORE THE STORM,Thorne,"Now, now! Is that any way to talk to a man who is about to make you a deal?"
1,17,Two-Face Part I,CALM BEFORE THE STORM,Thorne,"Oh, I think you will be, unless of course you'd rather I speak with Big Bad Harv? Or perhaps you'd prefer I speak to the press first?"
1,17,Two-Face Part I,CALM BEFORE THE STORM,Thorne,There's a limo waiting in the alley. Take it! While you still have a career ahead of you. (Harvey hangs up the phone)
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Thorne,"But it makes for such fascinating reading. Listen to this, boys. It says here when Harvey was a little boy, he was bothered by a bully. Every day the bully would bug him after school, until one day, little Harvey got so mad, he slugged him one."
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Thorne,"Of course, the bully ran away, which made little Harvey feel very proud. Until he heard the bully was in the hospital."
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Thorne,"That's what Harvey thought. Except the guy was in the hospital for appendicitis! (chuckles) But poor Harvey felt so guilty, he never showed his anger again. And that was the start of Big Bad Harv."
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Thorne,Just a few favors from the D.A.'s office.
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Thorne,"Otherwise, as a concerned citizen, I'd feel compelled to give this to the press. After all, the people of Gotham have a right to know the kind of person, or should I say, ""persons"" they've elected. So, what do you say, Harvey? Do we have a deal?"
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Thorne,What's that?
1,17,Two-Face Part I,HARVEY'S DOWNFALL,Thorne,Get them!
1,17,Two-Face Part I,"FRACTURED FACE, FRACTURED MIND",Thorne,I wish I could be sure of that.
1,18,Two-Face Part II,THORNE'S CONTRACT,Thorne,"Six months of this long enough! Spread the word. I'm putting on a contract. One million... no... Make it two million! A million dollars a face, to the man who brings me Two-Face."

1,18,Two-Face Part II,RUPERT THORNE VS. TWO-FACE,Thorne,"No, no. She thought she was alerting the police. She wanted to save you."
1,18,Two-Face Part II,RUPERT THORNE VS. TWO-FACE,Thorne,"That file is here, alright. Now, where is it!?"
1,18,Two-Face Part II,RUPERT THORNE VS. TWO-FACE,Thorne,"(turns towards Grace) Such a pretty face, are we?"
1,18,Two-Face Part II,RUPERT THORNE VS. TWO-FACE,Thorne,Give me the file. (Two-Face surrenders the file) Get rid of them.
1,18,Two-Face Part II,RUPERT THORNE VS. TWO-FACE,Thorne,This is the last time you interfere with me!

1,21,Vendetta,INTERROGATING THORNE,Thorne,"He-- that loser? I wouldn't wipe my shoes on him! Conway's got nothing on me! Let'im talk! He coulda talk his head off, no problem!"
1,21,Vendetta,INTERROGATING THORNE,Thorne,"Aaahh! Don't just stand there, you clowns! Get-me-down!"

1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE MASTERMIND,Thorne,"Now, now, just relax man and tell me what's on your mind."
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,GANGLAND,Thorne,"You should be happy, Sidney! - Through one in a million mishap, you've realized the dream of every criminal in Gotham."
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,GANGLAND,Thorne,The utter demise of Batman!
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,THE AMBUSH,Thorne,"Hm, from pitching pennies to rubbing elbows with The Joker. Not bad, Sidney."
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Thorne,So the famous Sid the Squid is nothing but a pathetic victim of circumstance. Just how stupid do you think I am?
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Thorne,You think I didn't hear the rumors of the third-rate stumblebum who rubbed out the Batman? And now you say you accidentally made a fool of the Joker? No one's that lucky or stupid!
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Thorne,Admit it! You're trying to muzzle in on my drug racket! You've been playing dumb so you can get a shot at me!
1,48,The Man Who Killed Batman,BIG SHOT,Thorne,"Sure I'll get you out of Gotham, Sidney, in a pine box! - You!"

1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,RECKONING,Two-Face,"Don't you forget it! - Since our little stunt at the rally, I got the city thinking you're the best thing since the Batman. Once Gordon's out of the picture, you'll be assured to take his place. In fact, they could be calling you Commissioner by tomorrow!"
1,60,Shadow of the Bat Part II,RECKONING,Two-Face,"I'm stepping up the time table. Too many people nosing around. This guy, that Batgirl chippie. I'm not taking any chances. My men'll bust Gordon out of jail tonight, then we'll dump him off................"

And eventually it will melt you. - Of course, you can save yourself simply by giving me your cape and cowl. After all, it looks like ..... are covered with wax! Now hurries. I'll wait. Uh, very inventive! Do you suppose it would work? - Congratulations, but don't breathe to deeply, Batman! It seems that when you shattered the lamp, you triggered the release of a toxic nerve gas from a tank in the ceiling. Now, your cape and cowl, please?"

1,54,Day of the Samurai,FINAL QUEST,Yoru,"I cannot tell you where the datal point lies, Wayne-San. I never allow myself to read the scroll for fear I might someday be tempted to use the forbidden knowledge."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,FINAL QUEST,Yoru,Yes. On a hand. An arm. A leg. Even a simple defensive block could mean doom.
1,54,Day of the Samurai,AFTERMATH,Yoru,"We all choose our own paths, Wayne-San! He walked a dark trail. It was not your responsibility. If you see Batman, tell him I have great respect for him."
1,54,Day of the Samurai,AFTERMATH,Yoru,"Not so. Batman offered to help his adversary, and a lesser man would have used the knowledge of the o-nemuri touch against his opponent. Batman is the essence of samurai, Wayne-San. You would do well to remember that."

1,49,Zatanna (episode),ZATARA,Zatanna,You can't. I lock your hand to the wall!

1,49,Zatanna (episode),DISAPPEAR,Zatanna,Uh-huh. And I've invited him here to find the secret of the feat I'm attempting tonight!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DISAPPEAR,Zatanna,"Well kids, impossible is what I'm all about. Mr. Fauncewater, open the doors, please. Ten million dollars and the means to make it. Take a good look folks, cuz you know what they say about money... easy comes, easy goes!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DISAPPEAR,Zatanna,"Thank you, Monty. And now, just so Irv doesn't have a fit, I'll bring it back, good as new. Arva-decarba!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DISAPPEAR,Zatanna,"Where's the money, he says. It's right there, isn't it?"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DISAPPEAR,Zatanna,"Now, take it easy, Irv, I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DISAPPEAR,Zatanna,"Now, wait a minute!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DISAPPEAR,Zatanna,"Look, it's a trick- and illusion! I don't know what went wrong, but if we can all just calm down for a second..."

1,49,Zatanna (episode),RESCUE,Zatanna,"You know, I didn't love the idea of spending the night in jail, but this does technically make me a fugitive. I believe I'm looking at some prison time, now."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),RESCUE,Zatanna,What do you care about some leggy dame in nylons? Or have I answered my own question?
1,49,Zatanna (episode),RESCUE,Zatanna,"No, no. I'm sorry. I'm having a bad day."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Zatanna,This place is surrounded by cops!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Zatanna,That's where the money was.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Zatanna,That would've been one mighty big piece of glass... or mirror!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Zatanna,"Oh sure, take all the mystery out of life!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),INVESTIGATION,Zatanna,How did he get rid of a mirror that big?
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Zatanna,Only another magician would've known how to rig that trick!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Zatanna,He's been ripping off illusionists for years. I thought I finally had a trick even he couldn't expose. Wrong.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Zatanna,"Oh, no! Kane played me for a sap and I'll see him go down for it."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Zatanna,"Me? Who's got time for a relationship when you're pulling rabbits out of a hat 52 weeks a year? Besides, somebody's gotta keep the old act going now that Dad's gone."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Zatanna,Why?
1,49,Zatanna (episode),CLOSER,Zatanna,"Thanks. You know, I have the weirdest feeling that we've met before."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),TRAPPED,Zatanna,You're not gonna have a face when I'm done with you! Now you slimy... (gasp)
1,49,Zatanna (episode),TRAPPED,Zatanna,"Oh, I would hope so."

1,49,Zatanna (episode),DEBUNKED,Zatanna,"Ta-da! Oh, Monty, you fell for the second oldest trick in the book. And here's the first!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DEBUNKED,Zatanna,Scared? That makes two of us!
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DEBUNKED,Zatanna,Zanna?
1,49,Zatanna (episode),DEBUNKED,Zatanna,"Don't you know, a magician doesn't make the same trick twice!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Zatanna,So... you never wrote.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Zatanna,"Hey, it's okay. I can see you've been busy. Just answer an old friend a question."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Zatanna,What happened that made you put this on?
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Zatanna,"I'd say you're keeping that promise pretty well. And for what it's worth, Dad would have been proud of you tonight."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),REMEMBER,Zatanna,"John- I hate goodbyes too. Love, Zanna. P.S. Don't forget to write."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),ZATARA,Zatara,"Remember, concentration and control. Focus on them and you can master any escape. Go! - Congratulations! You've beaten your old time by six seconds!"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),ZATARA,Zatara,You've got the makings of a great magician. I'm sorry you're going to be moving on.
1,49,Zatanna (episode),ZATARA,Zatara,"But to what end? Three months ago you appear on my doorstep, with no interest in performing. And yet, dying to become an escape artist. And for some reason, I wound up teaching you secrets, I've never shown another magician."
1,49,Zatanna (episode),ZATARA,Zatara,"No. There was something inside you I had no right to deny. Something deep and painful. After all, I would be foolish to assume I was the only one with secrets, hey, ""John Smith""?"
1,49,Zatanna (episode),ZATARA,Zatara,"I'll miss you John, and so I trust will Zatanna."

1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FUGITIVE,Zucco,"Yeah, who is it? Hello? Hello!? Who's there? Augh! (Hangs the phone) I don't like it. You sure Batman didn't follow you?"
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FUGITIVE,Zucco,"Don't tell me what I have to worry about! I'm not back in town five minutes, five minutes, and he's on my tail. You don’t know the Bat. He don't let up. He's a dark angel of death, man, and he wants me."
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FUGITIVE,Zucco,How should I know? What's that?
1,52,Robin's Reckoning Part II,FUGITIVE,Zucco,Sshh! Listen.
